# Doing weekly challange from IAmTimCorey

## Resource
I'm doing a challange from IAmTimCorey youtube channels. Here the link : [His youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj-aTJOVqNs)

## Primary challange:

Create a console app that will rename every text file in a folder to be standart casing (first letter or each word capitalized).
Also replace any instance of Acme with TimCo in the names.

Result :
* From console

* Exact folder

## Bonus challange:
Using the files in the advanced folder, rename the files based upon the first line of each files. 
So if File1.txt has a first line of Testing, the new file name should be Testing.txt.
Make sure to retain the extension type.

Result : 
* From console
